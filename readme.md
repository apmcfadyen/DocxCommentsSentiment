As an aspiring author, feedback from my beta readers is my most valuable resources. But as the size of my projects and the number of comments I get increases, it becomes more difficult to keep track of all my comments and characterize readers' thoughts as positive or negative. This is my attempt to collect, measure, and categorize feedback, especially for multi-chapter projects.

This program takes a folder full of .docx files, and gives the user the option of a long or short analysis. The output is a csv with a name of the user's choosing, which can be analyzed elsewhere.

Future updates will include more GUI and customization options. Possibly also more analysis within the actual program. When my beta readers are done with my current novel-length project, I'll also create a tableau report to show my findings.
